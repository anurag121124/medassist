# 🚀 MedAssist Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ Environment variables configured with your Supabase credentials  
✅ Enhanced database migrations created  
✅ TypeScript types updated  
✅ Authentication system updated to use Supabase Auth  
❌ Service role key needed  
❌ Database migrations need to be applied  

## Next Steps

### 1. Get Your Service Role Key
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/ttsclzqgafrjhesdpykj/settings/api
2. Copy the **service_role** key (NOT the anon public key)
3. Update your `.env.local` file:
   ```bash
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... (paste your actual service role key here)
   ```

### 2. Apply Database Migrations
Once you have the service role key, you can apply the migrations:

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/ttsclzqgafrjhesdpykj/sql
2. Copy the content from `supabase/migrations/20250706160000_enhanced_medassist.sql`
3. Paste it into the SQL editor
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

**Option B: Using our migration script**
```bash
./apply-migrations.sh
```

### 3. Test the Connection
```bash
node test-supabase.js
```

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables Needed

Your `.env.local` file should have:
```bash
# Supabase (✅ Already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ttsclzqgafrjhesdpykj.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# ❌ Still needed:
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

## Error Resolution

The "Invalid API key" error you encountered was because:
1. The service role key was still a placeholder
2. The code was trying to use a non-existent `users` table
3. The migrations hadn't been applied yet

All of these issues have been fixed in the updated code. Once you add your service role key and apply the migrations, everything should work perfectly!

## Available Commands

```bash
# Test Supabase connection
node test-supabase.js

# Apply migrations (after service key is set)
./apply-migrations.sh

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Get service role key instructions
./get-service-key.sh
```
